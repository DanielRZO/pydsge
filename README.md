# pydsge
Python class to handle linearized DSGE models.



# Model Especification
* Model declaration with symbolic variables
* linearized

# Model Solution
Based on the implementation of Christopher A. Sims' `gensys` function.
You can find the author's original matlab code
[here](https://dge.repec.org/codes/sims/linre3a/).
The paper explaining the solution method is
[this one](https://dge.repec.org/codes/sims/linre3a/LINRE3A.pdf).

# Model Estimation
* Bayesian

# Drawbacks
* slow performance due to the symbolic library

# Colaboration
* Feature suggestion on the project page
